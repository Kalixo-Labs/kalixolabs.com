Understanding your products and materials is key to growing your business. Kalixo Labs will provide detailed analysis into the atomistic building blocks of your materials, and give your business the insight it needs to improve and roll out new and exciting products.


## Quantum Mechanical Simulation and Modeling

Quantum mechanics you say? Let us do the heavy lifting and determine what makes your materials tick. We use state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the inner workings of materials at the atomic scale. Some examples of what insights we can provide:

- Thermodynamic properties
- Material characteristics such as stress/strain and bulk moduli
- Electronic structure 
- Conductor/Semi-conductor properties
- Density of states

Understanding your material at a fundamental scale can give your engineers and scientists a better understanding of where improvements can be made, new product applications, and much more.

## Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Modeling

Molecular dynamics (MD) has proven to be one of the most useful tools for understanding your product at a larger scale, in particular its interactions with different solvents, environments, and other compounds. We use prebuilt and DFT-based custom potentials to build you thermodynamically accurate models that give you a look into the dynamics of your product.

- Solubility studies
- Displacement studies
- Thermodynamic properties
- Energy barriers
- Quantum-accurate characterization of materials

Giving your business the tools it needs to understand your materials and processes can be the difference between a good product and great one. Let us provide the tools so you can drive your business forward.

## Molecular Docking

Docking simulations have become one of the most prominent methods for understanding how small molecules interact with larger structures, giving insight into how and where your product will interact with its surroundings in solution. We have the expertise to bring you docking characteristics in many use cases, including the following:

- Ligand/protein docking
- Remediation studies
- Small molecule binding preferences
