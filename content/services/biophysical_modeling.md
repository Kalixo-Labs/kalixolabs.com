Understanding your products and materials is key to growing your business. Kalixo Labs will provide detailed analysis into the atomistic building blocks of your materials, and give your business the insight it needs to improve and roll out new and exciting products.



## Molecular Docking

Docking simulations have become one of the most prominent methods for understanding how small molecules interact with larger structures, giving insight into how and where your product will interact with its surroundings in solution. We have the expertise to bring you docking characteristics in many use cases, including the following:

- Ligand/protein docking
- Small molecule binding preferences
- Ligand Design


## Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Modeling

Dynamics 

- Protein/ligand interaction simulations
- Membrane bound protein simulations
- Interaction energies
- Dynamic conformation search
