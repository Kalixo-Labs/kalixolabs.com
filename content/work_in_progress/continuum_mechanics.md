## Macroscopic Fluid Simulations and Reactor Optimization

Molecular dynamics (MD) has proven to be one of the most useful tools for understanding your product at a larger (yet still very small) scale, in particular its interactions with different solvents, structures, and other environmental factors. We use pre-built and DFT-based custom potentials to build you thermodynamically accurate models that give you a look into the dynamics of your product.

- Fluid flow processes
- Reactor design and 
- Thermodynamic properties
- Energy barriers
- Quantum-accurate characterization of materials
